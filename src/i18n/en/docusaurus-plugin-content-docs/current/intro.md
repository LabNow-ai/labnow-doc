# LabNow Tutorial - Quick Start

## Your Swiss Army Knife for AI & Data Science

In a nutshell, `LabNow` ( [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/LabNow/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/LabNow-ai/) ) is an **out-of-box Data Science / AI environment and platform** at your fingertip which you would love 💕.

With Docker and `LabNow`, you

- 📦 can start your data science / AI projects with nearly `zero configuration` - LabNow puts everything about installing (latest) packages and configuring environment into standard docker images and sets you free from these tedious work.
- 🌍 will find your work more `easy-to-reproduce` - LabNow standard images make scientific research or data analysis project as [reproducible pipelines](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07196-1) and help you [share your work with others](https://doi.org/10.1038/515151a).
- 🆙 can easily `scale-up and scale-out` your algorithms and key innovations - LabNow help you move forward smoothly from the development stage to deployment stage by re-using these images to either to provide RESTful APIs or orchestrate map/reduce operations on big data.

## What's actually there

`LabNow` curates and maintains a series of Docker images including interactive computing environment to run a Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) with Python, R, OpenJDK, NodeJS, Go, Julia, etc. Other IDE-like tools (e.g VS Code, R-Studio) are also included.

`LabNow` supports use cases of both research and production:

- (Stand-alone) Use it on your laptop as default data science / develop environment.
- (Multi-tenant) Use it on a server/cluster to host multiple users to exploit hardware resources like GPU.
- (Deployment/Production) Use it as the base image to host RESTful APIs or work as executors or map/reduce operations.

## How to use? `1-2-3-GO`🎉

### 0. Have docker installed on your laptop/server

- Linux (e.g.: Ubuntu LTS): install [docker-ce](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=community&type=edition&operating_system=linux) ( community version & free: ) directly (or install other container services like podman).

- macOS: install [docker-ce-desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

- Windows (>=10):

  - Option 1 (recommended): install WSL2 and latest Ubuntu distro, and then install [docker-ce](https://hub.docker.com/search/?offering=community&type=edition&operating_system=linux) just like on Linux.
  - Option 2: [docker-ce desktop](https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Special reminder for GPU and cuda users

**Docker installed from default Ubuntu/CentOS repository probably won't work for GPU!**

If you want to use *NVIDIA GPUs* with `LabNow`, Linux server or latest Windows WSL2 is **required**.

After installing **Docker >= 19.03**, also install both

- the [`NVIDIA driver`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-install-the-nvidia-driver) that fits your hardware,
- and the latest version of [`nvidia-container-toolkit`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#quickstart) to use the GPUs in containers.

### 1. Choose the features and choose a folder on your disk

- Choose a folder on your laptop/server to server as the base directory (e.g.: `/root`, `/User/me`, or `D:/work`). Use an absolute path instead of relative path -- files in this folder are visible in the environment (files outside this folder are not).

- Choose an tag from [LabNow feature matrix](tutorial-basics/labnow-stacks-1-foundation.md) (e.g `full` for your laptop, or `full-cuda` for a Linux server with NVIDIA GPU), depends on what features/moduels do you want.
Typically, you can choose `full` / `full-cuda` if you have enough disk space and no worry about your network speed.

### 2. Start the container

Change the value of `IMG` and `WORKDIR` to your choices in the script below, and run the script. Shutdown Jupyter or other service/program which are using port 8888 or 9999.

#### For Linux/macOS/Windows WSL, run this in bash/terminal

```shell
IMG="LabNow/base-dev:latest"
WORKDIR="/root"  # <- macOS change this to /Users/your_user_name

docker run -d --restart=always \
    --name=LabNow \
    --hostname=LabNow \
    -p 8888:8888 -p 9999:9999 \
    -v $WORKDIR:/root \
    $IMG
sleep 10s && docker logs LabNow 2>&1|grep token=

```

⚠️ To use `LabNow` with NVIDIA GPU machines with `nvidia-docker`, be sure to:

- 👉 Use **Docker >= 19.03** and the command `nvidia-smi` works well on host machine
- 👉 Add option (after `--restart=always`) in the `docker run` command to enable GPU access: `--gpus all` (for older version of nvidia-container, use `--runtime nvidia`)  
- 👉 Use `IMG="LabNow/full-cuda"` or other images with cuda support

#### For Windows, run this in [Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) or CMD

Docker on Windows doesn't support GPU yet (cuda WSL support is coming soon).

```cmd
SET IMG="LabNow/full:latest"
SET WORKDIR="D:/work"

docker run -d --restart=always ^
    --name=LabNow ^
    --hostname=LabNow ^
    -p 8888:8888 9999:9999 ^
    -v %WORKDIR%:/root ^
    %IMG%
timeout 10 && docker logs LabNow 2>&1|findstr token=

```

### 3. Sit back for minutes and get the first-time login token

The commands in the last step will:

- trigger a docker image download process which may take minutes
- start a docker container named `LabNow`
- print a string contains a URL, which includes a 48-digit hexadecimal number

Copy the printed hexadecimal string *after* `?token=` as the first-time login token.

### Go! 🎉

Access `http://localhost:8888` (or `http://ip-address:8888`) in your browser and paste the token you just copied to start the journey.

## Additional Information

### FAQ

For a list of FAQ or other information, please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/LabNow-ai/docker-images/wiki) of this repo.

### Hardware

The images are built based on `ubuntu:latest` and only tested on the `x86` platform.
Minor modifications are expected to port to `arm64`, `ppc64le` platform.

### Package Management

Although `conda` is installed, we do not recommend to use conda to install a lib/package, because:

- `conda` repo mirrors are generally not avaliable in restricted enterprise LAN, especially in fincial/medical related companies.
- `conda` does not reuse the existing system library yet if a system lib is already installed -- `conda` installs it again.
- An open-source alternative, `mamba` is installed.

### Customization

These images are highly customizable. If you find a system lib / Python module / R packages is missing, you can easily add one in the `install_XX.list` in the `work` folder. Utilites scripts and functions in `/opt/utils` folder will be helpful for custimize images.
